# ðŸ§‘ðŸŒ¾ Agrilife Extension

## What is Agrilife Extension?

Agrilife Extension it's a Vintage Story mod that adds lots of new vegetables and in the near future it'll improve the agriculture system in the game.

This mod will be 100% compatible with Expanded Foods. I'm working on it and it'll be done asap.

## Where can I download it?

The mod can be dowloaded from the official [Agrilife Extension ModDB](https://mods.vintagestory.at/agrilifeextension) page!
